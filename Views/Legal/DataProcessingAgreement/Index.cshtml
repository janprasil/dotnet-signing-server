    <h1>Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 25. 11. 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") forms part of the agreement
        between you ("Customer" or "Controller") and <strong>Performance4 s.r.o.</strong>
        ("Processor") governing the use of the <strong>P4PDF by Performance4 s.r.o.</strong> service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Subject Matter and Duration</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall process personal data on behalf of the Controller
        for the purpose of providing the Service as described in the main agreement
        and this DPA. The processing shall continue for the duration of the main
        agreement, unless otherwise agreed.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature and Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <p>
        The Service enables the Controller to upload and process documents (PDFs,
        attachments) for the purposes of electronic signing, timestamping and
        related operations. Personal data may appear within such documents and
        related metadata.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Types of Personal Data and Categories of Data Subjects</h2>
    <p>The types of personal data processed may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses and other identifiers;</li>
        <li>Contact information and billing data;</li>
        <li>Any personal data contained in documents uploaded by the Controller.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data subjects may include:</p>

        <li>Controller’s employees and representatives;</li>
        <li>Customers, suppliers and other business contacts of the Controller;</li>

    <h2>4. Instructions of the Controller</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall process personal data only on documented instructions
        from the Controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data
        to a third country, unless required to do so by law. The Controller’s use
        of the Service (configuration, API calls, uploads) constitutes such instructions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall ensure that persons authorized to process personal data
        have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
        statutory obligation of confidentiality.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational
        measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>encryption in transit;</li>
        <li>access controls and authentication;</li>
        <li>segregation of environments;</li>
        <li>logging and monitoring;</li>
        <li>regular updates and security patches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Sub-processors</h2>
    <p>
        The Controller hereby authorizes the Processor to engage sub-processors
        for hosting, payment processing, timestamping and related services.
        The current list of sub-processors includes (without limitation):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stripe – payment processing;</li>
        <li>freetsa.org – timestamp authority (TSA) in case API is used without TSA custom specification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Processor shall impose data protection obligations on sub-processors
        that are no less protective than those in this DPA.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Subject Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Processor shall
        assist the Controller, by appropriate technical and organizational measures,
        in fulfilling its obligation to respond to requests for exercising data
        subjects’ rights (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability,
        objection).
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall notify the Controller without undue delay after
        becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting data processed
        on behalf of the Controller.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Deletion or Return of Data</h2>
    <p>
        Upon termination of the main agreement, the Processor shall delete or
        return all personal data processed on behalf of the Controller, unless
        EU or Member State law requires storage of the data.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Audits</h2>
    <p>
        The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information
        necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and shall allow for
        and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller
        or another auditor mandated by the Controller, not more than once per year,
        unless otherwise required by a competent authority.
