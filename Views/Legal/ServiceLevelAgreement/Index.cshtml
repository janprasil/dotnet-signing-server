    <h1>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 25. 11. 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") describes the availability and
        support commitments for the <strong>P4PDF by Performance4 s.r.o.</strong> service.
        It applies only where explicitly referenced in your subscription or
        separate agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
        We target a monthly uptime of <strong>99%</strong> for the core API
        and web interface, excluding:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>planned maintenance windows,</li>
        <li>outages caused by third-party providers (e.g., cloud hosting, Stripe, TSA),</li>
        <li>force majeure events (e.g., natural disasters, war, major outages of the Internet).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Planned Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        We may perform planned maintenance that can cause temporary unavailability.
        Where reasonably possible, we will notify customers in advance via the
        web interface, email or status page.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Incident Response Times</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to respond to incident reports within the following timeframes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical issues</strong> (service completely unavailable): response within 8 business hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Major issues</strong> (significant degradation): response within 24 business hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Minor issues</strong> (non-critical bugs): response within 48 business hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Service Credits</h2>
    <p>
        If the monthly uptime falls below the target, you may be eligible
        for service credits, calculated as a percentage discount on the
        recurring fees for the affected month, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uptime between 98% and 99%: 5% credit,</li>
        <li>Uptime between 95% and 98%: 10% credit,</li>
        <li>Uptime below 95%: 20% credit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Service credits must be requested in writing within 30 days after
        the end of the month in which the incident occurred and are applied
        to future invoices or credits in the system. Service credits are
        your sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime target.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Exclusions</h2>
    <p>
        This SLA does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination
        of the Service that is caused by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>factors outside our reasonable control,</li>
        <li>Customer’s or third-party hardware or software,</li>
        <li>misuse or abuse of the Service,</li>
        <li>trial or free tiers (unless explicitly stated otherwise).</li>
    </ul>
