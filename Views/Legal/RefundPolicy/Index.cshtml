    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 25. 11. 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        This Refund Policy describes when you may be eligible for a refund
        related to purchases made within the <strong>SignProxy by Performance4 s.r.o.</strong> service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Credits and Non-Refundability</h2>
    <p>
        You can purchase credits through Stripe to use specific features or API
        endpoints. Unless required by applicable law, credits are non-refundable
        and non-transferable once purchased.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Double Charges and Technical Errors</h2>
    <p>
        If you believe you were charged twice or there was a technical billing
        error, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@performance4.cz">support@performance4.cz</a>
        with details of the transaction. If we confirm that an error occurred
        on our side, we will issue an appropriate refund or credit adjustment.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Service Unavailability</h2>
    <p>
        In cases of prolonged service unavailability, your remedy is limited to
        service credits as described in the applicable SLA (if any). Monetary
        refunds are generally not provided for temporary outages.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
        If you initiate a chargeback with your payment provider without first
        contacting us, we may suspend or terminate your account due to unresolved
        payment issues.
    </p>
