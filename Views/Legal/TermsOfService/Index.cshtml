    </p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
        The Service allows you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>digitally sign PDF documents,</li>
        <li>attach trusted timestamps to documents,</li>

        <li>purchase and consume credits via Stripe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Service is provided as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, accessible
        via web and API endpoints documented separately.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Accounts and API Tokens</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials
        and API tokens. Any operation performed using your credentials or API token
        is deemed to be performed by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must immediately notify the Provider if you suspect any unauthorized access
        to your account or API token.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Credits and Payments</h2>
    <p>
        Credits are purchased through Stripe. Credits are consumed when calling
        specific API endpoints or performing operations defined in the pricing model.
    </p>
    <p>
        Credits do not constitute electronic money, have no monetary value and
        cannot be exchanged back for cash, unless required by applicable law or
        explicitly agreed by the Provider.
    </p>
    <p>
        All prices may be shown excluding or including VAT depending on your
        location and the Provider’s tax obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
        You agree not to use the Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law,</li>
        <li>to infringe any intellectual property rights of third parties,</li>
        <li>to upload or distribute malicious software or harmful content,</li>
        <li>to abuse or overload the Service infrastructure (e.g., via automated attacks).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Legal Status of Generated Documents</h2>
    <p>
        The Provider supplies a technical tool for signing and timestamping PDF documents.
        The Provider does not provide legal advice and does not guarantee that
        any document produced using the Service is legally binding or complies
        with specific regulatory frameworks (including, without limitation, eIDAS
        qualified signatures).
    </p>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for the legal adequacy, correctness and
        enforceability of any documents you generate, sign, store or distribute
        using the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Availability and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        The Service is provided on a commercially reasonable efforts basis.
        Unless a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA) is in place, no specific
        uptime guarantees are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Provider may perform planned maintenance that can result in temporary
        unavailability of the Service. Where reasonably possible, such maintenance
        will be announced in advance.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
        The Provider implements reasonable technical and organizational measures
        to protect the Service, including encryption in transit and restricted access
        to production systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, no system can be completely secure, and the Provider cannot
        guarantee absolute security of data.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Suspension and Termination</h2>
    <p>
        The Provider may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>you materially breach these Terms,</li>
        <li>your use causes or risks causing harm to the Service or other users,</li>
        <li>the Provider is required to do so by law or by competent authority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may terminate your account at any time via the web interface or by
        contacting the Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties,
        whether express, implied or statutory, including but not limited to
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Provider shall not be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages, loss of
        profits, loss of data or business interruption, even if advised of the
        possibility of such damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The total aggregate liability of the Provider for any claims arising out
        of or related to the Service shall be limited to the total amount paid
        by you for the Service during the twelve (12) months preceding the event
        giving rise to the claim.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Open-Source Components and AGPL</h2>
    <p>
        The Service uses open-source components, including iText 9, which is
        licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0).
    </p>
